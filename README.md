In today's digital age, music streaming platforms have become the primary gateway for millions of people to discover, consume, and interact with music. Spotify, Apple Music, and Shazam are three key players in this digital music ecosystem, each with millions of active users and vast song libraries. This makes the combined data from these platforms a very rich and representative source for conducting in-depth analysis of music trends, listener preferences, and overall music industry dynamics.

The dataset we chose as the primary focus of this paper is a compilation of data covering metrics from these three leading platforms. The available information includes audio attributes such as tempo, pitch, energy, and danceability, as well as descriptive data such as song popularity, genre (where available or inferred), and release date. Furthermore, this data also provides important metrics related to song engagement across various playlists and charts on Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer, as well as Shazam chart data. Thus, this dataset allows us to conduct a comprehensive multidimensional analysis, exploring the relationships between various factors and gaining in-depth insights into the complex digital music ecosystem.

The combined popularity and relevance of these platforms in today's popular culture guarantee that the findings from this dataset analysis will have significant practical and theoretical significance. The results of this study can provide valuable insights for various stakeholders, including musicians, producers, record labels, aggregators, and music app developers. Furthermore, this dataset analysis can also contribute to a broader understanding of how digital technology has transformed the way people discover, consume, and interact with music globally.
